**cut up** is a contemporary adaptation of the [cut-up technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique), as made popular by the dadaists, and as closely associated with William S. Burroughs.

**cut up** pulls in recent news articles about William S. Burroughs or mash-ups, cuts those articles up, and reassembles them to form short open poems, akin to the physical technique. The typeface choices are intended to emphasize the cut-up nature of the work, without trying to emulate a printed page.

You can add the app to your home screen on an iOS device and run it from there for a full-screen experience. The page refreshes every 30 seconds to give you brand new poetry, or you can refresh the page sooner by tapping the title in the toolbar.

**cut up** was created by [Nick Heer](http://nickheer.com). It is built with PHP on [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) with a modified [Readable](http://bootswatch.com/readable) theme.
